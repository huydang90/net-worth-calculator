# Description

This prototype app helps to calculate your net worth over time, in three different scenarios: when you buy a property, when you just rent and save money, and when you use your savings to invest in medium-yield assets.

## Instruction
You can toggle your information on the left. The default values are taken from the average of the German market condition. You can change all value to fit with your current situation. You can use this in two ways: 1) Compare different scenarios of money management to see what would benefit you the best; 2) Have an overview of your overall net worth from different investment and saving strategies


In your local machine, you can run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` to open this in your browser.
